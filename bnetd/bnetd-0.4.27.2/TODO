TODO

	This file contains a list of things which we plan to fix or implement.
	There is no real ordering to the list other than I tend to put newer
	stuff at the top.  If you want to work on any of these items feel free
	to do so.  It might be a good idea to post notification on the
	bnetd.org webpage or the bnetd-dev@bnetd.org mailing list so nobody
	else duplicates your work.
	
	Items marked with an asterisk(*) are intended to be completed before
	the next stable release.

	- The client requested channel name (Diablo II) seem to be identital
		in D2DV and D2XP while the configuration in channel.list allows
		only one channelname-clienttag combination
    * Test if private channels (/pchannel /join) are secure when connected
      via telnet (JEBs20030103 Telnet in gerneral didn't work by me :o Why ?!)
    - Reduce packet size by using different sized buffers per class or by
      making the buffer be dynamically resizable
	- Allow channels to be client-type restricted
	- Allow channels to be join-restricted (to specific users or to no
	  users)
	- Allow channels to be marked as "no-chat" (The Void is a good example)
	- Remove startver checking and most places where it is printed
	- Cleanup bnchat and bnstat so that everything is not in main() and
	  extract identical parts into another file
	* Implement another state for bnet connections to handle clients that
	  have not done version authentication so that server may implement
	  strict checking
            (JEBs20030101 Think its done since the new VersionChecking parameters)
	* Make d2cs and d2dbs network defaults "just work" for the case where
	  all three daemons (or four with a game server) are running on the
	  same computer
            (JEBs20030101 Think it's done too since bnetd/d2cs/d2dbs is listening
             on all addresses/interfaces. A new installation can be started without
             any changes of the conf files. Or i'm wrong ?!)
	- Attributes on channels to restrict them to certain character classes
	- Implementation of the /teams command which allows clans to formalize
	  membership and more easily moderate their channel
	- A configuration option to automatically purge old accounts (accounts
	  that haven't been used in a certain period of time)
	* Update token parser to handle backslash escapes (\\,\",\n,etc.)
	* Change channel code to support flags instead of all the random field
	  names and to allow proper CF_ bits to be set in MF_CHANNEL messages
	* Change channel code to support explicit "aliases" so that multiple
	  clients can be placed in the same official channel
	- Cleanup server.c so that it isn't so long
	* Convert clients to use addr.c utility functions
	* Configuration file to create command aliases (eg:
	  /haha -> /me laughs) (Ross is working on it)
            (JEBs20030101 Think it's possible since "bnalias.list")
	- $TERM detection in bnchat (turn on ansi if detected)
	- A Macintosh port (not as important now since MacOS X can use the
	  Unix version)
            (JEBs20030101 MAC OS < X isn't supported by Apple anymore)
	- Version authentication emulation in bnchat
	- A utility to automatically create a versioncheck configuration file
	- A hierarchical users directory to speed up directory searches
	  (Hakan is working on it)
	- Use timezone bias for displayed times (ladder, last game, etc.)
	- A ladder configuration file
	* Add data in man pages for all config files (bnetd.conf is mostly
	  done)
	- Work with the FreeCraft people to get both the client and server
	  side working
	- A document to familiarize new coders with bnetd
	- Fix OS description reporting for Win32 (include version)
	- An optional way to ban certain words from account names, channel
	  names, game names, and chat messages... full regexp engine?
	- Add support for old non-ANSI compilers (ansi2knr in configure)
	- A scheme for automatically handling game listings between different
	  network interfaces... address translation plus spawning UDP proxy
	  daemons?
	- A local command mode for bnchat to implement ladder info and user
	  info (Ross is working on it)
	- Latency tests using the UDP pings instead of the TCP ones for DRTL,
	  STAR, SEXP, and W2BN clients
	- Support for proxying game info in bnproxy; this requires munging
	  GAMELIST packets and updating all that crufty code (not needed
	  on Linux anymore because there is a netfilter module)
	- Support for the SESSIONADDR2 packet in bnproxy and binding to unique
	  UDP ports for each virtual client... people with NAT could use this
	* Add an option to have more lax checking of game reports
	* Fixed STARTGAME gamestatus parsing, and check if the flag is really
	  two 16 bit ones... test with all versions of StarCraft since they
	  changed this with nearly every patch (*important to fix before next
	  stable release!*)
	- Command line option for bnstat to print out ladder lists
	- Support for guest style multi-login accounts
	- Support for anonymous style multi-login accounts
	- Support for authentication of normal maps for ladder games (maybe
	  fixed? maybe done client-side so impossible?)
	- Possibly a hash table for account attribute lookup
            (JEBs20030101 Think it's in and is working perfectly)
	- A scheme to allow multiple programs to access the user files at once;
	  a daemon which handles all reads/writes has been suggested (Onlyer is
	  working on this)
	- A way to block certain types/versions of clients from connecting
	- Sorting of GAMELISTs so open and newer games are first (and games of
	  same client patch level)
	- Support for picking ads by client and account and enforced display
	  times
	* Max users and/or max connections entry in config file (0==infinity)
            (JEBs20030101 "Max_accounts" is already in. Think "Max_Connections"
            will be problematic i think, cause: how you'll inform the client
            that the server is full ?! Simply by dropping the connection ?!)
	* Idle logout config option (time between receiving any type of
	  packets)
            (JEBS20030101 "use_keepalive" & "nullmsg" does this, isn't it ?!)
	- Admin commands to modify channel attributes
	- Support for account and channel bans by IP/hostname
	- Comments in source code for most files, types, and functions
	- Command to remove stale games from the list
	- Some nice utilities for managing accounts that could be used in
	  shell scripts, etc
	- Use terminal settings for erase/clear in clients instead of assuming
	  the terminal is a vt100
	- Inter-server communication (bits protocol) (Typhoon is working on it)
	- Latency status on STAR/SEXP game lists (which field is it?) (does
	  this already work!?)
	- It would be nice to have a GUI to display/edit the configuration
	  options, user accounts, current status, and send a SIGHUP to the
	  daemon when appropriate
