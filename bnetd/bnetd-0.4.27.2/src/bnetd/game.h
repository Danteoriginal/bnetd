/* Just a quick note for BITS: The original gamelist is only
 * kept by the master server. The bits clients only have a
 * 'stripped down' bits_gamelist. Information which is not
 * really relevant is just dropped. To emulate a t_game struct
 * bits clients can still use the bits_game_create_temp()
 * function. However this function can only reconstruct a small
 * piece of information which is stored in t_game. But it should
 * generally be enough to work with it ...
 * If you wonder why the (t_connection *) fields are replaced by
 * (unsigned int) fields there is an easy answer: The master server
 * doesn't store a t_connection struct for every user on the server
 * but he can reconstruct one from the bits_loginlist. Therefore the
 * t_connection struct is only built when it's needed but only the
 * sessionid for it is permanently stored.
 * Game reports are sent to the master server in raw packet format.
 * They are all evaluated there.
