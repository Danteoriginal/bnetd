     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q1.1">1.1) What is the bnetd Project?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The project is a collaboration focusing on development of the bnetd
       server.  This is a program that attempts to emulate
       <a HREF="http://www.blizzard.com/">Blizzard</a>'s
       <a HREF="http://www.battle.net/">Battle.net</a> service.  The bnetd
       project is run by volunteers and neither supported by nor otherwise
       affiliated with Blizzard Entertainment.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       A major part of the effort is supporting all Bizzard's Battle.net
       compatible games.  The server may eventually support some non-Blizzard
       clients as well, but no work is currently being put into that.
       Certain software in addition to the bnetd server should also be
       considered part of the bnetd project.  This includes BNS (BNetd
       Selector), bnchat (a text-based chat client), the BNI utilities, and
       bntrackd (BNetd TRACKing Daemon).  The bnetd team also produces
       documentation about these programs and the Battle.net protocol.
      </p>
      <br>
 
     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q1.2">1.2) What is Battle.net?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       To avoid confusion please note that Battle.net is a trademark of
       Davidson & Associates, Inc.  The term is used here to refer to their
       free (as in beer) online gaming services.  Their game division
       (maybe subsidiary?) is commonly called "Blizzard Entertainment" or just
       "Blizzard".
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Battle.net's servers communicate with their client products like
       Starcraft, Diablo, and Warcraft.  The servers provide chat rooms and
       lists of multi-player games to join.  Other services they provide
       include ladder rankings, permanant accounts, and client upgrades.
      </p>
      <br>
     
     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q1.3">1.3) What is Starcraft?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Starcraft is an RTS (real time strategy) game produced by Blizzard
       Entertainment.  It is unique in the fact that the game may be played
       from the point of view of three warring races.  The races are completely
       different to one another, and a great deal of design and thought has
       gone to creating a balance between the participating races.  Up to
       eight players (people or computer-controlled AIs) may play in a game at
       once.  The game has remained wildly popular years after it was first
       released.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Quite simply it's one of the most perfect examples of an RTS game
       currently available.
      </p>
      <br>
    
     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q1.4">1.4) Why create bnetd when Battle.net already exists?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Starcraft provides no method to play TCP/IP games other than using a
       proprietary service provided by Blizzard.  This service is often slow,
       and is sometimes down due to a crash or maintanence.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       For some people (at LAN parties, school networks, etc.) it is not
       possible to access Battle.net because of a lack of Internet connectivity
       or because of a firewall.  Using Battle.net chat rooms brings attention
       to your computer similar to using IRC.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       With the staggering numbers of players on Battle.net, it can be
       difficult to locate friends or other players willing to avoid using
       cheats or disconnecting when things aren't going their way.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Running your own server allows you to customize the login banner, the
       ad banners, channel names, account attributes (you can decide who is
       an operator or admin), and the ability to delete accounts of abusive
       players.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Last but not least, you have a significant chance to register an
       account with your favorite nick.  :)

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q1.5">1.5) What is the history of bnetd?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The project started around the time Starcraft was released.  It was
       created for hack value and as a solution for the problems mentioned in
       the reply to question <a HREF="#q1.4">1.4</a>.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The original work was done by Mark, who maintained releases on
       <a HREF="http://www.starhack.ml.org/">http://www.starhack.ml.org/</a>
       through version 0.3.  That version spawned several ports to MS-Windows,
       most notably FSGS.  The ml.org domain went away and the original code
       languished for a while.  Ross began working on patches to the code but
       found it difficult to distribute them.  Then Josh and his friends set
       up a site to revive the project on
       <a HREF="http://bnetd.unleashed.org/">http://bnetd.unleashed.org/</a>
       and collaboration quickly ensued producing the 0.4 release which
       supported account passwords (yea!).  Tim set up the bnetd.org domain and
       a permanent net connection.  Work continues, and an 0.6.x release should
       be out soon (0.5 will be skipped, see question <a HREF="#q2.5">2.5</a>).
      </p>
      <br>
     
     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q1.6">1.6) How can I subscribe to your mailing lists?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       There are actually two different sets of mailing lists.  The ones at
       bnetd.org (hosted by <a HREF="http://www.igateway.net/">igateway.net</a>)
       are older and have more subscribers.  The ones on SourceForge were
       used for a short period of time but are no longer really active.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       If anyone has bnetd-dev messages before June of 2000, please contact Ross
       so he can put together a historic archive.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q2.2">2.2) On what systems does bnetd work?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The answer of course depends on the version number.  0.4 should work on
       most systems after fixing the bug mentioned in question
       <a HREF="#q3.4">3.4</a>.  Later 0.4.x development versions and 0.6.x
       when it is released should work on almost any Unix-like system.
       Systems that have been tested recently are AIX, FreeBSD, HP-UX, Irix,
       OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, SunOS (gcc only). Even Win32 works.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       If you are installing from source, you will need an ANSI C compiler for
       0.4.x and earlier either an ANSI or K&R compiler for 0.6.x and later.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q2.3">2.3) Who is the bnetd team?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The makeup of the team isn't set in stone.  Currently there are only a
       few active developers, Ross and Typhoon.  Rob and Dizzy send in
       occasional patches.  Lots of others have sent in bug reports, patches,
       and useful information.  Tim provides a nice network connection, DNS,
       and a machine to run our webserver on.  For more details, see the
       CREDITS file which is included in the source tarfile.
      </p>
      <br>
    
     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q2.4">2.4) How can I help?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       If you have experience with C programming then grab the source and hack
       away.  Or if you don't have experience with programming go pick up some
       books on C, Unix, sockets, or whatever you are intererested in.  We are
       always glad to answer questions about the source or to help people
       develop their patches.  See the TODO file included with the source
       distribution for ideas to work on.  We are in need of a Macintosh
       network programming person to help port bnetd to the Macintosh.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       If you are into GUIs, you can work on the Win32 or Macintosh connection
       utilities called BNS.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       If you aren't into programming, download the source and compile it (or
       install a binary package), play with it, and tell us if you find
       problems and we'll add them to the TODO list.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q2.5">2.5) What is the versioning scheme?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       There are two active releases at any point in time: "stable" and
       "development".  The development versions eventually become the next
       stable release and a new development branch is opened.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The first two numbers separated by decimal points determine the release
       number.  So 0.3 and 0.4 are not only separate versions, but separate
       releases (instead of being two revisions from release "0").
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Either type of release should compile and generally work (in theory).
       More testing and effort is put into validating stable releases.  There
       are also "pre" releases like 0.4.22pre6.  They were introduced late in
       the 0.4.x development cycle and are mostly intended for keeping
       developers in sync.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       In the past, stable releases didn't have a third component.  The next
       development after stable release X.Y  would be X.Y.1.  The obvious
       problem with this is that it doesn't leave any room for having new
       versions in a stable release.  An example of the kind of problem this
       causes is the well-known bug described in question
       <a HREF="#q3.4">3.4</a>.  For this reason, the next stable release after
       the 0.4.x development cycle will be 0.6.x, <b>not</b> 0.5.  The
       development cycle after that will be 0.7.x.
      </p>

       This system is bascially be the same as the even/odd system used by
       the Linux kernel developers.

      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The 0.4 stable release has troubles compiling on recent glibc versions
       so I recommend not using it.  0.3 has so many features lacking that the
       only viable option is a recent 0.4.x development release.  Typically
       development versions are ok to use.  When 0.6.x is released, it should
       be the "default" install option for end users.

       This contains pointers to where log and player files may be found and
       also some tuning information so you can customize it to fit your needs.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q3.4">3.4) Why does the compiler generate an error in eventlog.c line 29?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       This is due to a bug in bnetd-0.4.0 and some earlier versions.
       Basically the code is assuming that stderr is a constant but that is
       untrue on newer glibc systems.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       There are several ways to fix it.  The simplest fix is to change
       <tt>stderr</tt> to <tt>NULL</tt> at the top of <tt>eventlog.c</tt> and
       recompile.  Upgrading to a newer version of bnetd also fixes the
       problem.  The 0.4 series can not be patched because of the way the
       versioning scheme works.  The <a HREF="#q2.5">new</a> scheme does not
       have this problem.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q4.1">4.1) How do I start bnetd?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       After you have built the source, the program binary is put into
       sbin/bnetd.  To run the server, just type:  sbin/bnetd from the bnetd
       main directory.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q4.2">4.2) Why don't I see anything when I start bnetd?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       By default, the bnetd process runs as a daemon in the background.  If
       you want to run it in the foreground, use the -f option when you launch
       the server.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Note that when the server is run in daemon mode, the first thing it does
       is a change directory to / so you need to make sure that all paths in
       your bnetd.conf are absolute paths.

      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The support for games other than Starcraft and Brood War was in its
       infancy at the time 0.4 was released.  So when using bnetd 0.4, some
       versions of Diablo difficulty connecting or starting games.  Versions
       of bnetd after 0.4.22 have good Diablo I support as long as your client
       is upgraded to version 1.05 or greater.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Before 1.05, Battle.net used a completely different protocol which
       looked liked database transactions and ran on a low port number.
       Support for this is now difficult to add since we don't have any
       packet traces.  If someone really wants support for this we would
       be willing to work with them.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q4.5">4.5) Why can't I connect with Diablo II?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Diablo II uses a new connection type that was not supported before
       bnetd version 0.4.23.  Later versions support this feature.  If you
       are already running 0.4.23 or later but still have problems, see the
       next paragraph.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       With patch 1.08 of Diablo II, Blizzard changed its CD Key
       authentification (again).  Release 0.4.25pre3 and earlier don't
       unterstand the new packet type.  Later releases should handle this
       properly (try the nightly CVS build if you wish to test the fix
       before the next release).
      </p>
      <br>
      
     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q4.6">4.6)How do I enable autoupdates?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Autoupdates are Blizzard's method of automatically upgrading game clients
       to the latest version when they connect to Battle.net.  Doing this ensures
       that all users have compatible game versions and will not have
       syncronization errors during game play.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Autoupdate was not easily usable with bnetd until version 0.4.22.
       This option can now be enabled by editing two configuration files and
       placing at a version authorization MPQ and an upgrade MPQ in the files
       directory..
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       First open your <tt>bnetd.conf</tt> and find the "Downloadable files"
       section.  Change the <tt>allow_autoupdate</tt> option to <tt>true</tt>.
       This enables client version authorization.  Now change
       <tt>mpqauthfile</tt> to be the filename of an authorization MPQ.  This
       should just be the filename, not the full path.  An example filename is
       IX86ver1.mpq.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Second, open your <tt>autoupdate</tt> configuration file and uncomment
       the lines for the clients you wish to upgrade.  The middle column should
       just be a filename not a complete path.  The version field can be
       computed from the upgraded client version number.  For example 1.05
       becomes 105 and 1.08 becomes 108.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The MPQ files can be obtained from Battle.net using <tt>bnftp(1)</tt> or
       you can search for them on the world wide web or get them from an FSGS
       distribution.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q4.7">4.7) How do I add admin rights to an account?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Find the account file with the uid of the user you want to change (you
       can use grep from the shell or the /whois command on the server).  Then
       shut down the server if it is running.  Using any text editor you like
       add a line like this:<br>
   <tt>"BNET\\auth\\admin"="true"</tt><br>
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       There are other authorizations you can enable on accounts.  Most of them
       are documented in the bnetd_default_user configuration file.  For example,
       you can prevent an account from ever becoming an operator by adding this
       line:<br>
   <tt>"BNET\\auth\\operator"="false"</tt><br>

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q4.8">4.8) Why does my game client crash with a divide by zero error?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       If this happens while connecting to the server and your game client
       is recent then it is probably because of a missing or empty TOS.txt
       file in the bnetd files directory.  The client will requested a file
       based on the three-letter country abbreviation.  Clients may also
       request a Unicode (16bit but not UTF16) version of the file.  There
       is a script called tos.sh which should have created these files when
       bnetd was installed.
      </p>
      <br>
     
     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q4.9">4.9) Why does the server refuse to allow my client to connect?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       There could be many reasons for this but there are two common cases.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The first is that the server has version authentication enabled and
       your client is not listed as a valid version.  This could be due to
       an incomplete list on the server or because of unrecognized patches
       or mods.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The second is that the server is misconfigured.  Even if the server
       has skip_versioncheck enabled it will still do the versioncheck
       with new clients like Diablo II and LoD.  There is no known way
       around this.  In order to do the version checking there must be
       some authentication MPQ files in the bnetd files directory.  Some
       example names are IX86ver1.mpq and PMACver3.mpq.  Check the bnetd
       logfile for messages from file_send.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q5.1">5.1) How do I connect to a server through my firewall?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       This is one of the most asked questions and also one of the hardest to
       answer.  Of course the answer depends on your network setup and which OS
       you use on your firewall.  If you use NAT (or masquerading) then it gets
       even more complicated.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The first thing you might want is the port information.  The protocol
       uses TCP port 6112 on the bnetd server.  It also uses UDP port 6112 on
       both the client and the bnetd server.  If you use Diablo II, then TCP
       port 4000 also needs to be open to the server.  The clients will also
       talk to each other on UDP port 6112 during a game.  If port 6112 is not
       available on the client when it binds the socket, it will receive on a
       random port number.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Even if your setup works with a single machine one game or two machines
       in two different games, that is no guarantee that more than one machine
       will work smoothly in the same game.  The most common symptom of a setup
       problem is "serious" lag during gameplay.  The current theory is that
       the game is sending the traffic for all the clients through a single
       client.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       A thorough writeup of the issue was done by Dizzy.  It's called
       <a HREF="http://bnetd.dyndns.org/files/docs/bnet-masq-howto">bnet-masq-howto</a>
       and while it focuses on Linux 2.2, it has lots of general information as
       well.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       For Linux 2.4 using iptables (AKA Netfilter), there is good news.  It
       is possible using full NAT (SNAT+DNAT) to get rid of the lag for any
       combination of machines inside or outside the firewall.  There is a
       <a HREF="http://msgs.SecurePoint.com/cgi-bin/get/netfilter-0102/367.html">message</a>
       from Rick Kramer on the Netfilter mailing lists describing how to set it
       up.  In his case, he is assuming the Battle.net server is outside the
       local network.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The instructions for Linux kernels 2.0.36 have been recorded below:
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       A simple way to connect to a Battle.net-like server is to use the
       <tt>ipautofw</tt> program to add a forwarding rule for the packets,
       where x.x.x.x is the client machine.
      </p>
      <tt><pre>
   /sbin/ipautofw -A -r tcp 6112 6112 -h x.x.x.x -v -u
   /sbin/ipautofw -A -r udp 6112 6112 -h x.x.x.x -v -u
      </pre></tt>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       This works for single-user games or for games with only one computer
       from the internal network or for games hosted by an external computer
       with any number of external computers and at most one internal computer.
       Confusing enough?
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Normally when the bnetd server is also behind the firewall, and a game
       is hosted by an internal computer, only other internal computers can
       join.  The gametrans settings can use used to tell bnetd about the
       address translation that is happening so that this does not happen.
       This way, bnetd will know not to give out the local addresses
       (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x, or whatever) to computers outside the firewall.

      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Even when you do that, as soon as you have two or more players from the
       local network in the same externally-hosted game serious lag will occur.
       As far as we can tell this is unavoidable on non Linux-2.4 sytems
       without a kernel module or proxy.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Similarly, if two or more computers are in the same internally-hosted
       game from outside the local network, serious lag will occur.  A solution
       for this has been found (it worked for me).  All of the details are in
       this message on the official Linux Masquerading list available at
       <a href="http://home.indyramp.com/lists/masq/msg03024.html">http://home.indyramp.com/lists/masq/msg03024.html</a>.
       What it basically says is that the kernel connection tracking will
       get confused by multiple remote computers talking to the same port on
       an internal computer (actually it will think the other computers are
       trying to break through the firewall).  The solution for this is known
       as loose UDP port management.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       This isn't enabled by default in any Linux kernel version it is a slight
       security risk.  If you have a UDP server running on say port 9999 and
       your computer sends a UDP packet from port 9999 to Internet host A, then
       Internet host B can connect back to your server on port 9999 if it
       guesses the correct proxy port number.  This isn't an issue if the only
       UDP traffic will come to and from bnetd.  Keep in mind that DNS requests
       are UDP.  If you decide not to do this, you can still make things work
       by setting up manual port forwarding entries for each client machine
       (FIXME: I think... or does that need loose UDP as well?).
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       For 2.0.36 and below you must add two kernel patches for loose UDP.  The
       first patch is called "LooseUDP" and updates the masquerading code to
       include an experimental option "CONFIG_IP_MASQ_LOOSE_UDP".  FIXME: I
       don't know what the second patch is... maybe that was a typo above in a
       previous version of this document.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       For 2.2.15 and later kernels, no patches are needed.  These kernels
       include a sysctl which is accessable as
       <tt>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_masq_udp_dloose</tt>.
       There are three possible values which can be <tt>echo</tt>ed into this
       file.  A "0" (default) means not to allow loose UDP port management.  A
       "1" means to allow it for unprivileged ports.  A "2" means to allow it
       for all ports (bnetd should work fine with "1").
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       For 2.4.x, there doesn't seem to be a sysctl for Loose UDP handling.
       This means you will need to use manual port forwarding for each machine
       as described in the Netfilter mail list message listed above.

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q5.2">5.2) How do I choose which server to connect to?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       So now you've got bnetd running, how do you point your Starcraft
       client at the server?
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Once Starcraft, Diablo, or another client is installed, you can use a
       program named
       <a href="http://bnetd.dyndns.org/files/tools/BNSv1103.exe">BNSv1103.exe</a>
       to switch between different bnetd servers and Blizzard's Battle.net.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       This program has a simple interface that has a radio button that lets
       you switch between the Blizzard Battle.net server or <tt>Other</tt>.
       To use <tt>Other</tt> click on the radio button next to that entry and
       type in your hostname or IP address below.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       You can also use BNS to launch your game automatically by selecting it
       inside the Launch box.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       You can also change the server while the client is running.  For example,
       with Starcraft you should return to the first screen past Multiplayer
       where you can choose <tt>Ok</tt> or <tt>Cancel</tt> to connect to the
       Battle.net server.  Use Alt-Tab to switch to either BNS (if it is still
       running) or to Windows Explorer and select a new server and click
       <tt>Apply</tt>.  Then switch back to Starcraft and click <tt>Ok</tt> to
       connect to the new server.
      </p>
      <br>

     <div CLASS="faq_question"><a NAME="q5.3">5.3) I'm using BNS but it doesn't select my server?</a></div>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       If you are using BNS 1.1.0.3 or older with Starcraft/Brood War 1.08 or
       newer, Diablo 1.08 or newer, or Diablo II then you are not alone.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       This is because Blizzard has changed the registry format to support
       client-side selection of the Battle.net gateway (USWest, USEast, etc.).
       While this is a very nice change, BNS hasn't yet been updated to handle
       the new format.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       The <a HREF="http://mybnet.org/">MyBnet project</a> provides a selection
       <a HREF="http://mybnet.org/files/BnetGCfg.exe">utility</a>
       which is reported to work quite nicely.  Jeff has kindly offered to
       contribute the program to the bnetd project.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       There is a
       <a HREF="http://bnetd.dyndns.org/files/tools/blizzard/GateSel.exe">gatesel.exe</a>
       program which could be found on Blizzard's ftp site which is supposed
       to be able to handle the new format.
      </p>
      <p ALIGN=justify>
       Failing that, there are
       <a HREF="http://bnetd.dyndns.org/files/docs/README.diablo108">instructions</a>
       for how to use regedit to manually enter the server.  These instructions
       are included in current bnetd releases as <tt>docs/README.diablo108</tt>.
       Note that some versions of Windows use 16 bit characters in the text fields.
