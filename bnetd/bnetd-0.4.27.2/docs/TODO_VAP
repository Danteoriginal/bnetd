Here are some projects on my TODO list (24 Jul 2000).

- Speed optimisation for ladder computations
  - Probability() using a table for small ranking differences
    As it is unlikely that very high ranked players play against
    very low ranked players, a table may be used for a given
    rank differences interval. For greater differences, the
    mathematical formula may still be used. This will allow to
    limit it to a table of, for example, 255 double (-127 to 127)
    that will catch most of the cases.
  - Math expanding then factorisation. This is the best optimization
    that could be done to these math functions but it'd render these
    math expressions nearly impossible to understand.
- Config option to set minimum number of game won before someone may enter
  a ladder game. This would also allow playing ladder directly after account
  creation (for example, for LAN parties) (except the client tries to enforce
  this too.  I believe it is hardcoded to 10 normal wins).
- Gimp script to convert to indexed with a correct palette for creation
  of ad banners.
