As of Starcraft version 1.08, and recent versions of Diablo II, the
mechanism for selecting Battle.Net servers has changed. Read the
instructions in /usr/share/doc/bnetd/docs/README.diablo108 to find out
how to modify your registry appropriately.

NOTE: If you have trouble remove the bncache.dat file from your game
directory.
