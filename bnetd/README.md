Which version?
==============

0.4.27.2 is the newer version and the version that [my personal MacPorts port for bnetd](https://github.com/cooljeanius/LocalPorts/blob/master/net/bnetd/Portfile) points to, but 0.4.25 is version that I have been doing more messing around with, and is the same version as the [Portfile for bnetd in MacPorts trunk](https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/net/bnetd/Portfile).

Why have you not merged the two?
================================

Because I am bad at git.
