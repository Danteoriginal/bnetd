TODO

	This file contains a list of things which we plan to fix or implement.
	There is no real ordering to the list other than I tend to put newer
	stuff at the top.  If you want to work on any of these items feel free
	to do so.  It might be a good idea to post notification on the
	bnetd.org webpage or the bnetd-dev@bnetd.org mailing list so nobody
	else duplicates your work.
	
	Items marked with an asterisk are intended to be completed before the
	next stable release.

	- Attributes on channels to restrict them to certain character classes
	* Better mail notification... at least notify at login if there is
	  new mail.
	- A /ping or /latency command to print client->bnetd TCP latency
	- Implementation of the /teams command which allows clans to formalize
	  membership and more easily moderate their channel 
	- A configuration option to automatically purge old accounts (accounts
	  that haven't been used in a certain period of time).
	* Update token parser to handle backslash escapes (\\,\",\n,etc.)
	* Change channel code to support flags instead of all the random field
	  names and to allow proper CF bits to be set in MF_CHANNEL messages.
	* Change channel code to support explicit "aliases" so that multiple
	  clients can be placed in the same official channel.
	* Change /watch with no argument to print watch list with an asterisk
	  next to the players which are online.
	* Change code to save the watchlist.
	- Cleanup server.c so that it isn't so long
	- Cleanup FD_SETSIZE usage.  Find out the portable way to redefine it
	  and/or make an autoconf check to see if we can redefine it
	* Convert clients to use addr.c utility functions
	* Configuration file to create command aliases (eg:
	  /haha -> /me laughs)
	* Complete the versioncheck parser
	- $TERM detection in bnchat (turn on ansi if detected)
	- A Macintosh port (could either be Unix-style libc or native with
          OpenTransport... maybe not important now since MacOS X can use the
	  Unix version?)
	- Version authentication emulation in bnchat
	- A utility to automatically create a versioncheck configuration file
	* Finished Diablo II closed character storage and start on a game
	  server (and fix the playinforeq to search the character list as
	  well as the account list) (Onlyer and crew are working on this)
	- A hierarchical users directory to speed up directory searches
	  (Hakan is working on it)
	- Make ipban use list.c
	- Use timezone bias for displayed times (ladder, last game, etc.)
	- A ladder configuration file
	* Add data in man pages for all config files (bnetd.conf is mostly
	  done)
	- Work with the FreeCraft people to get both the client and server
	  side working
	- A document to familiarize new coders with bnetd
	- Allow 1.2.3.0/netbits syntax in bnban file
	- Fix OS description reporting for Win32
	- An optional way to ban certain words from account names, channel
	  names, game names, and chat messages... full regexp engine?
	- Add support for old non-ANSI compilers (ansi2knr in configure)
	- A scheme for automatically handling game listings between different
	  network interfaces... address translation plus spawning UDP proxy
	  daemons?
	- A local command mode for bnchat to implement ladder info and user
	  info (Ross is working on it)
	- Latency tests using the UDP pings instead of the TCP ones for DRTL,
	  STAR, SEXP, and W2BN clients.
	- Support for proxying game info in bnproxy; this requires munging
	  GAMELIST packets and updating all that crufty code
	- Support for the SESSIONADDR2 packet in bnproxy and binding to unique
	  UDP ports for each virtual client... people with NAT could use this
	* Add an option to have more lax checking of game reports
	* Fixed STARTGAME gamestatus parsing, and check if the flag is really
	  two 16 bit ones... test with all versions of StarCraft since they
	  changed this with nearly every patch (*important to fix before next
	  stable release!*)
	- Command line option for bnstat to print out ladder lists
	- Support for guest style multi-login accounts
	- Support for anonymous style multi-login accounts
	- Support for authentication of normal maps for ladder games (maybe
	  fixed?)
	- Possibly a hash table for account attribute lookup
	- Verification of ladder equations for 7 and 8 players 
	- A scheme to allow multiple programs to access the user files at once;
	  a daemon which handles all reads/writes has been suggested (Onlyer is
	  working on this)
	- A way to block certain types/versions of clients from connecting
	- Warcraft III support
	- Sorting of GAMELISTs so open and newer games are first (and games of
	  same client patch level)
	- Support for picking ads by client and account and enforced display
	  times
	* Max users and/or max connections entry in config file (0==infinity)
	* Idle logout config option (time between receiving any type of
	  packets)
	- Admin commands to modify account attributes
	- Admin commands to modify channel attributes
	- Support for server, account, and channel bans by IP/hostname
	  (Gediminas is working on it)
	- Comments in source code for most files, types, and functions
	- Command to remove stale games from the list
	- Some nice utilities for managing accounts that could be used in
	  shell scripts, etc
	- Use terminal settings for erase/clear in clients instead of assuming
	  the terminal is a vt100
	- Inter-server communication (bits protocol) (Typhoon is working on it)
	- Latency status on STAR/SEXP game lists (which field is it?) (does
	  this already work!?)
	- It would be nice to have a GUI to display/edit the configuration
	  options, user accounts, current status, and send a SIGHUP to the
	  daemon when appropriate
