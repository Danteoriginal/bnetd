INSTALL

	This file contains an outline for installing bnetd-0.4.25 on Unix-like
	systems.  The process for Win32 is much different and documented in
	docs/README.BORLAND.  If you use the MSVC++ compiler, the install
	process has not been documented yet.


STEPS

	 1) All the source code is in the src directory.  First change to that
	    directory with the "cd" command.

	 2) Run the configure script.  If you get an error like "configure:
	    command not found" try typing "./configure".  The command should
	    print lots of progress messages and complete successfully.   This
	    results in a Makefile and config.h customized for your system.  You
	    may pass it options to modify the way the program is configured.
	    Run configure with the "--help" options to display a list of
	    avaliable options.  The most common need is to modify the location
	    that the server should be installed.  The defaults for these
	    values are:
	     --prefix=/usr/local
	     --bindir=/usr/local/bin
	     --sbindir=/usr/local/sbin
	     --localstatedir=/usr/local/var
	     --sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc
	     --mandir=/usr/local/man
	    The directories "users", "reports", "files", and "chanlogs" will be
	    created underneath the localstatedir directory during installation.
	    You may want to use --localstatedir=/usr/local/var/bnetd or a
	    similar variation.

	 3) Now type "make".

	 4) Hopefully there will be no errors during the compile.
	    the server executable is "sbin/bnetd"
	    the proxy executable is "sbin/bnproxy"
	    the password encrypter is "bin/bnpass"
	    the chat client executable is "bin/bnchat"
	    the bot client executable is "bin/bnbot"
	    the file download client executable is "bin/bnftp"
	    the player stat client executable is "bin/bnstat"
	    the BNI utilities are "bin/bnibuild" "bin/bniextract" "bin/bni2tga"
	                          "bin/bnilist" "bin/tgainfo"

	 5) You may now optionally type "make install".  This will copy the
	    binaries, man pages, and configuration files to the directories you
	    specified in step 2.  The configuration file will be automatically
	    updated before it is copied to reflect the locations of the other
	    files.  Be warned: if you already have configuration files in the
	    destination directories, they will be overwritten.  If you run the
	    "make install" command, you can skip to step 7.

	 6) If you don't run "make install" you must copy the file named
	    "bnetd.conf.in" to "bnetd.conf".  You will probably need to make
	    changes to the file as descibed under step 7.

	 7) Check the "bnetd.conf" file to verify it suits your preference
	    before running the server.  Pay special attention to the files,
	    tracking, and policy sections.  Note the filenames in this file are
	    relative to the top (root) directory of the system, so it is best
	    to use absolute paths.  If you do not want your server information
	    to be sent to tracker.bnetd.org, leave the track time variable set
	    to 0 (zero) and/or specify a different tracking server, otherwise
	    set the time interval to something like 150 seconds.  You may also
	    wish to edit channel.list, bnmotd.txt, and bnetd_default_user.
	    Some files in the "files/" directory might also be of interest for
	    those people who like to customize things.

	 8) There is little or no reason to run this server under the root
	    account, so consider creating a special account for it or run it as
	    another unprivileged user.  Just make sure the bnetd files and
	    directories are both readable and writable by that user.

	 9) If you wish to run the server "in-place" (from the directory you
	    compiled it in), make sure you are in the top level bnetd directory
	    (the one with this file) and type "./sbin/bnetd -f".  This should
	    start your server in the foreground.  You may also run it in the
	    background by leaving off the "-f", but it will only work correctly
	    if you used absolute paths as step 7 suggests.

	10) If you ran "make install", you may start your server by simply
	    typing "bnetd".  If you get an error like "bnetd: command not
	    found" that means the server is not in your search path and you
	    will need to type the full path of the binary (for example, type
	    "/usr/local/sbin/bnetd").  The server will automatically background
	    itself.

	11) If there are problems, you may wish to look in the "bnetd.log" file
	    for error messages.  If the server was unable to initialize the
	    network, there may already be a bnetd server running on that
	    computer or another program like bnchat or CDE (dtspcd) may be
	    running and bound to TCP and/or UDP port 6112.
