# This file is used to check client versions and tag it for upgrades
#
#
# if you use more than entry for archtag/clienttag you must include each eqn/mpqfile/checksum
# for all the versions
# if exeinfo is "NULL" exeinfo check is disabled
# if checksum is 0 checksum check is disabled
# Versiontag is options, and it's used to identify a particular version, it's used
# with autoupdate, here you can tag a version and identify it later for a specific upgrade
# this is usefull, upgrading versions like 1.09c to 1.09d which have same version number
# you can use checksum to figure out the difference
