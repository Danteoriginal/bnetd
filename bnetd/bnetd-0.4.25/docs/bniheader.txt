The .bni files are used to store the icons for the diffrent games
in bnet. The file consists of two parts:
	1. The BNI header, which contains information on the number of
	   icons and the information about each icon.
	2. A Truevision TGA (Targa) file which contains the icon data in
	   one big image. The color depth is 24 bpp, so it's true color.
	   Blizzard puts here a compressed TGA.

At this time every icon seems to be 28x14 pixels, but the size is saved for
each icon. The BNIfile starts with 2 32-bit little-endian integers with the
values 0x10 and 0x01. I don't know what they are good for. The next field is an 
integer which contains the number of icons in the file. This field is followed
by another integer which contains the start offset of the TGA image. 

File Header:

	Unknown1	Unknown2	Number of icons		TGA Offset
	0x00000010(int)	0x00000001(int)	      int                  int

Now there are icon records for every icon. They are 16 or 20 bytes long:

Field Name	Id	X	Y	| if (id == 0):	|	unknown
					|	tag	|
Field Size	int	int	int	|	int	|	int

The tag field is only avail if the id field contains zero. The fields X and Y
contain the width and the height of the icon. The unknown field seems to be
always zero.

In the TGA file the icons are put from the top to the bottom in one bar.

If you know what these unknown fields mean or you discovered any errors,
