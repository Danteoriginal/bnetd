**** 10 Apr 2000 ****
- Added 5-players ladder computations (not tested against real
  ladder results)
- changed type of parameters of the functions six_f* and eight_f*
  to be integer instead of double (Ladder ranking). This should be
  a minor improvement on the speed.

**** 13 Jul 2000 ****
- Corrected bug in /ladderactivate
- Checked ladder-5
- updated INSTALL to explain the configuration for Diablo 1.08
- Added Bnetd gimp palette for ad banner generation.

**** 24 Jul 2000 ****
- New Starcraft client uses "DynKey\STAR\1\rank" and "DynKey\SEXP\1\rank"
  keys instead of the previous "Record\STAR\1\rank" and "Record\SEXP\1\rank".
  account_get_strattr silently returns the content of the Record key when a
  DynKey is requested so old and new clients are both suported.

**** 25 Jul 2000 ****
- Math optimizations. 
  - Factorisations. In ladder-8, probability function is called more than
    6000 times less. Also many multiplications suppressed (all ladders).
  - probability(a,b) = 1 - probability(b,a). Many probability calls suppressed
    using this.

**** 30 Jul 2000 ****
- Ladder 7 calc. Already partially optimized. This must still be compared
  to real ladder results to see if results are close.
- Identified field "unknown5" in CLIENT_COUNTRYINFO packet. (Time Zone) 
  Updated program to use it (right now, it use US-MDT TimeZone. The rest of 
  the packet is set to that land anyway).
